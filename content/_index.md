# Welcome

My name is Carson He. I am currently a University of Utah master's student studying computer security. I earned a bachelor's degree in computer science magna cum laude, also from the University of Utah, in spring 2024.

I enjoy participating in cybersecurity CTF events, and my favorite CTF challenge categories are cryptography, reverse engineering, and binary exploitation. This site has a [list of writeups](/ctf-writeups) for CTF challenges that I have solved. Additionally, in my free time, I enjoy tinkering with [GNU/Linux](https://stallman-copypasta.github.io/), reading, and playing chess.

I use Arch btw.
